## <a id="about"></a>About
Welcome! I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at Stanford University. My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics, causal inference, and gender, focusing specifically on low‐ and middle‐income countries affected by conflict.

I am currently working on projects in Kyrgyzstan (and Central Asia more broadly) and India. 

Before starting my PhD, I served as a consultant at the World Bank working on data privacy in Eastern and Southern Africa and as a Policy & Communications Intern at J-PAL’s Gender Sector translating RCT findings into actionable policy insights. I hold a MASc in Data, Economics, and Development Policy from MIT.
